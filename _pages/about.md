I am an Associate Professor and the Programme Director of MSc Power Systems Engineering in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering/ucl-mechanical-engineering) at University College London. Additionally, I serve as the deputy chair of the Marine, Autonomy, and Robotics Systems (MARS) research group, where I lead activities in advanced marine and maritime research. Prior to joining the department, I worked as a Research Fellow in Robotic Vision and Autonomous Vehicles at the Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey. I earned my MSc degree in Power Systems Engineering and a PhD degree in Marine Control Engineering, both from University College London in 2011 and 2016, respectively.

My research primarily focuses on automation and autonomy, with a special emphasis on exploring technologies related to sensing, perception, and the guidance and control of intelligent and autonomous vehicles. I am featured among the World's Top 2% Scientists by Stanford University in both 2022 and 2023. Additionally, I received the Denny Medal, awarded by the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science, and Technology (IMarEST).
